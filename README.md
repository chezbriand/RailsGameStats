This Python Script is for analyzing the history from a Rails game. It will create a graph of a players
cash at the end of each round and calculate some statistics from the game. 
```
python GameStats.py <filename> <starting_cash>
```
There are a few sample files included in the release. In order to create a file from your own game, you need to save the history to a txt file. 
Copy Paste to Notepad in order to create the txt file. Make sure to clean up the bottom so there is no extra text.
